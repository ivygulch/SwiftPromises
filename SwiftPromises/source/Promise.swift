/**
* A Swift version of the Promise pattern popular in the javascript world
*
* "A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
* The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its then method, 
* which registers callbacks to receive either a promiseâ€™s eventual value or 
* the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled."  (https://promisesaplus.com) 
*
* "The point of promises is to give us back functional composition and error
* bubbling in the async world. They do this by saying that your functions 
* should return a promise, which can do one of two things:
*  - Become fulfilled by a value
*  - Become rejected with an error" (https://gist.github.com/domenic/3889970)
